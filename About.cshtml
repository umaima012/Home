                    American ballerinas and dancers come from all over the nation, and are trained in both large and small studios. Most begin dancing as young children near home, and then relocate as high school or college students to a more prestigious studio that will help launch a budding career. Many American dancers head to New York for these opportunities, which is home to American Ballet Theatre and the Juilliard School - both famously known for producing star dancers. Still others forgo their American heritage to go study and enjoy a career abroad, with notable companies such as the Royal Ballet in London. Ballet dancers in this nation are fortunate to have many studios to choose from, as well as heralding from a region of the world that values artistic achievement.
